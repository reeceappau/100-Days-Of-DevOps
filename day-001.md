# Day 1: Linux User Setup with Non-Interactive Shell

## Task
The system admin team at xFusionCorp Industries needed to set up a user account specifically for a backup agent tool. Since this tool doesn't require interactive login, the requirement was to create a user with a non-interactive shell.
Task: Create a user named `ammar` with a non-interactive shell on App Server 1.

## Solution
```bash
# Create user with non-interactive shell
sudo useradd -s /sbin/nologin ammar

# Verify user creation and shell assignment
grep ammar /etc/passwd
```

**Key Learnings**

 Non-interactive shells (`/sbin/nologin` ) prevent users from getting interactive shell access
- Security best practice for service accounts, automated tools, and backup agents
- Prevents unauthorized shell access even if account credentials are compromised
