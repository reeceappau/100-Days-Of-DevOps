# Day 5: SELinux Installation and Configuration

## Task
Following a security audit, the xFusionCorp Industries security team has opted to enhance application and server security with SELinux. To initiate testing, the following requirements have been established for `App server 3` in the `Stratos Datacenter:`
1. Install the required `SELinux` packages.
2. Permanently disable SELinux for the time being; it will be re-enabled after necessary configuration changes.
3. No need to reboot the server, as a scheduled maintenance reboot is already planned for tonight.
4. Disregard the current status of SELinux via the command line; the final status after the reboot should be `disabled`.

## Solution
```bash
# Check OS version for correct installation commands
cat /etc/*-release

# Install SELinux packages
sudo yum install selinux-policy-targeted
sudo yum install selinux-policy-devel policycoreutils

# Trigger filesystem relabeling on next boot
sudo touch /.autorelabel

# Permanently disable SELinux
sudo vi /etc/selinux/config
# Set: SELINUX=disabled
```

**Key Learnings**
- SELinux implements Mandatory Access Control (MAC) on top of Linux's traditional Discretionary Access Control (DAC). 
- Traditional DAC uses user/group/other permissions (rwx). 
- MAC enforces system-wide security policies that restrict processes and users even if DAC permissions allow access.
- Security benefits: even if a compromised process has DAC permissions, SELinux policies can still block malicious actions.
